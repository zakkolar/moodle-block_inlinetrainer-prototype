# Block Inlinetrainer

This plugin was developed as a proof-of-concept that an inline trainer plugin could be created as a plugin for Moodle. To allow more flexibility, it was reimagined as a "local" plugin. The current version of the plugin can be found here: https://github.com/zakkolar/moodle-local_inlinetrainer
